# generalised-colley-matrix
An implementation of the [Colley matrix](https://www.colleyrankings.com/method.html),
meant to rate sports teams based on match results,
generalised to handle draws in addition to wins and losses.&nbsp;
I created this app to estimate relative strengths of 19th-century county cricket clubs,
but it can be used with any match data.&nbsp;
